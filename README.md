# effx charts

The canonical source for Helm charts is the [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io), an aggregator for distributed chart repos.

This GitHub project is the source for the `effxhq` Helm chart repository.

For more information about installing and using Helm, see the [Helm Docs](https://helm.sh/docs/).
